**Léon - The URL Cleaner** is an Android application which removes tracking and other obsolete
parameters from a URL before sharing. Its usage is simple, integrating into Android's standard
sharing mechanism.

Léon runs on Android 5.0 and later, is open source and does not contain any tracking or advertising
frameworks. Léon does not collect any data about you.

The benefits of removing tracking parameters are:

- Protects your and the recipient's privacy
- Improves readability of links
- Saves characters (in Tweets for example)
